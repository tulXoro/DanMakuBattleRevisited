# DanMakuBattleRevisited
Decided to revisit DanMaku Battle and change a bit of things to make it just a little bit more balanced (maybe) and improve my programming skills. This game is not intended to really be much of an official game, but more of a playground for me to explore programming.
#Launch
Already fixed a minor bug which was apparently present in the original game
